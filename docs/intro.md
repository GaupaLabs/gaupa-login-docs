- **API Key** (Very Sensitive): Your project's private API Key. Only to be used on the backend. Key rotation is strongly recommended.
- **JWT Tokens** (Sensitive): The user's JWT token when connected to Gaupa Login through your platform. Allows to get user information and trigger certain transactions.
