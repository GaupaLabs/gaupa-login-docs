# Transfers

Transfers allow to trigger different types of transactions on the user's behalf.

## Transfer Types

There are 4 types of transfers, similar to permissions. 

- EGLD (egld) for EGLD transfers.
- ESDT (esdt) for ESDT transfers.
- NFT (nft) for NFT and SFT transfers.
- Data (data) for non-token-transfer transactions.

## Only Allow Functions

For production we strongly recommend not using transfers and use Functions instead.

## Trigger a Transfer

A function allows to prefill values and only leave certain fields open to be filled or modified.
The formating of a function varies depending on the type./

Each function has a name which needs to be unique as it's used to be triggered.

### Params types
To facilitate your experience we're automatically converting the different parameters for you.
Here are the different types:
- Function (function): The function you wish to call (also works with ESDT and NFT transfers)
- String (string): Text passed as data.
- Number (number): Number passed as data.
- Address (address): A erd address passed as data.
