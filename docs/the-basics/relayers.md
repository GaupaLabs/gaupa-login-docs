# Relayers

Relayers allows to pay for the gas fees of another wallet. We've implemented it by default on Gaupa Login./
With relayers we then make sure that the user can get started interacting with the blockchain even without any EGLD.

# Relayer Credits

(Under Development)/
Each project has their own set of relayers, one for each Shard. They can get a Herotag (MultiversX Username)./
Gaupa Login aims to be accessible to all types of project, we're therefore working to implement card payment, bank transfer and crypto payments to top-up the relayer credits./
The credits are deducted from the project balance when relayers are being used.
